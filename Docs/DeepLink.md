# Deep linking


Deep Linking vs Deferred Deep Linking:

A deep link is a special URL that routes to a specific spot, whether that’s on a website or in an app. A “mobile deep link” then, is a link that contains all the information needed to take a user directly into an app or a particular location within an app instead of just launching the app’s home page.

If the app is installed on the user's device - the deep link routes them to the correct location in the app. But what if the app isn't installed? This is where Deferred Deep Linking is used.When the app isn't installed, clicking on the link routes the user to the store to download the app. Deferred Deep linking defer or delay the deep linking process until after the app has been downloaded, and ensures that after they install, the user gets to the right location in the app.

#### <a id="Deep-Linking"> The 3 Deep Linking Types:
Since users may or may not have the mobile app installed, there are 3 types of deep linking:

1. Deferred Deep Linking - Serving personalized content to new or former users, directly after the installation. 
2. Direct Deep Linking - Directly serving personalized content to existing users, which already have the mobile app installed.
3. Starting from v6.1.3, the new Unified Deep Linking API is available to handle deeplinking logic.

For more info please check out the [OneLink™ Deep Linking Guide](https://support.appsflyer.com/hc/en-us/articles/208874366-OneLink-Deep-Linking-Guide#Intro).

Check out the deferred deeplinkg guide from the AppFlyer knowledge base [here](https://support.appsflyer.com/hc/en-us/articles/207032096-Accessing-AppsFlyer-Attribution-Conversion-Data-from-the-SDK-Deferred-Deeplinking-#Introduction).

Code Sample to handle the conversion data:

###  <a id="handle-deeplinking"> 2. Direct Deeplinking
    
When a deeplink is clicked on the device the AppsFlyer SDK will return the resolved link in the [onAppOpenAttribution](https://support.appsflyer.com/hc/en-us/articles/208874366-OneLink-Deep-Linking-Guide#deep-linking-data-the-onappopenattribution-method-) method.

Code Sample to handle OnAppOpenAttribution:

###  <a id="unified-deeplinking"> 3. Unified deep linking

The flow works as follows:

1. User clicks the OneLink short URL.
2. The iOS Universal Links/ Android App Links (for deep linking) or the deferred deep link, trigger the SDK.
3. The SDK triggers the didResolveDeepLink method, and passes the deep link result object to the user.
4. The OnDeepLinkReceived method uses the deep link result object that includes the deep_link_value and other parameters to create the personalized experience for the users, which is the main goal of OneLink.

> Check out the Unified Deep Linking docs for [Android](https://dev.appsflyer.com/docs/android-unified-deep-linking) and [iOS](https://dev.appsflyer.com/docs/ios-unified-deep-linking).

Considerations:

* Requires AppsFlyer Android SDK V6.1.3 or later.
* Does not support SRN campaigns.
* Does not provide af_dp in the API response.
* onAppOpenAttribution will not be called. All code should migrate to `OnDeepLinkReceived`.
* OnDeepLinkReceived must be called **after** `initSDK`.
* AppsFlyer.cs **must** be attached to the game object.

Essentially, the Universal Links method links between an iOS mobile app and an associate website/domain, such as AppsFlyer’s OneLink domain (xxx.onelink.me). To do so, it is required to:

1. Configure OneLink sub-domain and link to mobile app (by hosting the ‘apple-app-site-association’ file - AppsFlyer takes care of this part in the onelink setup on your dashboard)
2. Configure the mobile app to register approved domains:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
    <dict>
        <key>com.apple.developer.associated-domains</key>
        <array>
            <string>applinks:test.onelink.me</string>
        </array>
    </dict>
</plist>
```
